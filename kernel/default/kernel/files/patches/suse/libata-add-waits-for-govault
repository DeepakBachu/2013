Subject: [PATCH] libata: add waits for GoVault
References: 246451
Patch-mainline: not yet

Iomega GoVault drives need specific waits here and there.  Upstream
approach hasn't been determined yet.  This is temp solution from Gary
Hade.  Read the following thread for details.

http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ide/14545/focus=14663

With recent changes in the reset sequence (ATA_TMOUT_FF_WAIT and
prefer-hardreset), the only thing which needs adjustment is
ATA_TMOUT_FF_WAIT (the prereset wait part is unnecessary as the wait
is necessary only for softreset when SCR registers are accessible and
in those cases libata now always uses hardreset which doesn't require
such wait).
