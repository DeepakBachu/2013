Subject: Increase limits for starting writeback of dirty data
References: bnc#449662
Patch-mainline: ?

Return limits for dirty pages writeback to the numbers from SLES10. This dramatically
improves performance of workloads dirtying a lot of memory (e.g. simple databases not
using direct IO) and we're not aware it would harm anything.
